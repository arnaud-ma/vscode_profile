# Configuration

## Settings

The settings are configured in the `settings.json` file of each profile. You can read the file to see the settings that are already configured.

To modify your own settings, you can navigate to **File > Preferences > Settings** and search for the setting you want to change.
Click on the little icon on the right (Open Settings (JSON)) if you want to directly modify your own `settings.json` file.

For example, if you want to change the font, you can either:
 - search "font" in the settings and change the font family
 - change or add the `editor.fontFamily` setting in the `settings.json` file.
